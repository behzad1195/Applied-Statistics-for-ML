### Intro
* I wanted to have some type of summary of most important statistical theories and methoods that we deal with them everytime that we want to run a model or do machine learning in my repo so I thought I can share it with you as well. It's not fancy nor cover all possible statistical theories that one should know in order to be a brilliant data scientist. 
* However I included another summary of mine in a word file(summary of Statistics 101.docx) that I gathered during my PhD but it's also only cover the short definition of main concepts with their formula in some cases there may be small proof of theory but nothing complicated or in depth. There is also a cheatsheet (365_Data_Science_Statistics_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) that you can get to main topic faster.
* In eqach folder there is ReadMe.md file that provide definition, its use, and where we use them in ML as well as links to the related ipynb file to looking at the code. I wrote small comments next to some lines of codes to explain them a bit better.
